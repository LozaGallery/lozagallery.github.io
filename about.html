  <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Having a <b>background in biology</b>, I am drawn to the art of painting <b>🌻 flowers</b> in their natural setting, specifically on bright sunny days with <b>☀️ maximum color contrast</b>. My paintings serve as <b>🖼 windows to summer</b>, bringing warmth and sunshine into your home during cold and gloomy seasons. Each artwork radiates a <b>☀️ sunny glow</b>, elevating your mood and infusing your soul with <b>🥰 joy</b>. My goal is to create an <b>💥 explosive effect</b>, igniting a burst of life and vitality as you gaze upon them.</p>

<p>My artistic journey began in <b>☀️ Kislovodsk</b>, a place blessed with countless sunny days, igniting an immense passion for creativity within me. The opportunity to create paintings in the <b>🏞️ Kislovodsk National Park</b>, with my own exhibit, contributed significantly to the growth of my artistic prowess. Motivated by demand and driven by the absence of formal art education, I compensated by tirelessly sketching everything living, inside and out, during my time at the <b>🔬 biology faculty</b>. As a result, I steer away from stylization and gravitate towards <b>✨ hyperrealism</b>. I aim to stay true to the original subject.</p>

<p>I expanded my artistic repertoire through self-education, mastering the art of <b>🧵 batik</b> and experimenting with paints from various countries. I discovered the <b>🎭 capricious nature of pigments</b> and how they can surprise you, especially when painting on expensive silk. This journey led to creating wearable art, such as <b>👚 batik clothing</b>, aprons, scarves, and shawls. My batik works also sought realism.</p>

<p>Next, I delved into the fundamentals of <b>💨 airbrushing</b>, a modern branch of art. My innovation came to life in the form of <b>👦 children's paintings</b>, where faces, hands, and feet of characters are airbrushed, giving them an authentic feel, while the clothing, nature, and objects surrounding the characters are meticulously painted by hand with acrylics. This technique enabled me to create a collection of children's paintings in various sizes with minimal time and material investment. As a result, thousands of my children's paintings now adorn children's rooms in my former country, serving as a timeless reminder of their childhood.</p>

<p>Due to political events, I relocated to <b>🇲🇪 Montenegro</b>, where I continue to paint. While my financial situation has restricted my creative potential (compressor for airbrushing, a wide array of batik materials, fabrics, paints, etc.), I now focus on what I call "designer paintings" – large, vibrant, <b>🌻 flower-themed artworks</b> that radiate the sun's brilliance.</p>

<p>These <b>🌻 sunflower-themed paintings</b> exude a magical energy (at least that's the effect I strive to achieve), becoming motivational forces in my life. I find it fascinating that flower-themed artwork is relatively uncommon among artists, making my pieces stand out uniquely. I hope my paintings resonate with others, evoking emotions similar to those I experience when gazing upon the finished artworks.</p>

<p>I will gradually share these paintings in subsequent posts. The process of creating them is slow and meticulous, taking about <b>⌛️ a month and a half</b> to complete a 40x55 cm canvas. It can only be achieved in a positive state of mind and a realm of <b>✨ positive energy</b>.</p>
